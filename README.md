Node.js is a simple and powerful tool for backend JavaScript development.
In this Project, I  covered the basics of Node.js and how to select an IDE. 
Second,  explored  template engines and how to render in HTML out of Express. 
Next,I learned  all aspects of routing, including express middleware. 
Finally, I worked  with multiple databases and backend APIs and covered  local security with Passport.js. 

Using the skills I learnt from this course, I built a system for managing children's details in an orphanage.
